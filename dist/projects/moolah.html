  <b>Problem space:</b> My roommates and I share a lot of expenses, and passing
  the same money back and forth between us is inefficient.
</div>
<div>
  <b>What it does:</b> A money-splitting bot which works similarly to the
  <a href="https://www.splitwise.com/">Splitwise app</a> by allowing any group
  of people in a shared Discord server to share expenses, reducing daily money
  transfer down to a few transactions however often you want. Moolah does not
  require any new sign-ups or app downloads, working locally in your Discord
  server.

  <b>Project path:</b>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Started off as "RoomieBot": a rudimentary Discord bot that worked only in
      our server with our initials. A wrong input would probably break the bot.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discord slash commands were released, and I realized I could make
      something much better and more versatile.
    </li>
    <li>
      Reworked the entire bot, but kept the base functionality of sharing
      transactions between a group of people.
    </li>
    <li>
      Utilized Discord's direct messaging to allow for personal transaction
      tracking and budgeting, and providing exporting capabilities to allow for
      integration with other budget trackers.
    </li>
  </ol>

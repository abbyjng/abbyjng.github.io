  <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-lightPurple">My Role</h2>
  <p>
    As a member of the Agent Platform team, I worked on Stripe's ticket
    resolution platform, <b>Case Studio</b>. This platform is the agent-facing
    side of the helpdesk, where agents are able to interact with customers to
    assist with questions and resolve help tickets.
  </p>
  <p>
    During my internship, I had the oppportunity to work on two different
    projects: Case Events and Agent Satisfaction. I also gained experience in
    code reviews, project scoping, and cross-team collaboration.

  <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-lightPurple">Project 1: Case Events</h2>
  <p>
    Agents often pass tickets off between each other, especially in ticket
    escalation. They should be able to easily see what decisions have been
    already made on the ticket.
  </p>
  <h3 class="font-bold mt-2">Summary</h3>
  <ul class="ml-4">
    <li class="list-disc">
      Added a data collection and display point into Case Studio which allows
      agents to see a log of what changes have been made to the case by
      themselves or by other agents
    </li>
    <li class="list-disc">
      Collected data on ~10k daily case changes and stored it in a MongoDB model
    </li>
    <li class="list-disc">
      Integrated data with existing case messages to create a visual timeline of
      a case's history

    Project 2: Agent Satisfaction (ASAT)
  </h2>
  <p>
    As developers of Case Studio, my team had no concrete and regular way to
    receive unbiased feedback from agents about how well Case Studio is working
    for them.

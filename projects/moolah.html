  <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-lightPurple">Problem Space</h2>
  <p>
    My roommates and I share a lot of expenses, and passing the same money back
    and forth between us is inefficient.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-lightPurple mt-3">What It Does</h3>
  <p>
    A money-splitting bot which works similarly to the
    <a href="https://www.splitwise.com/">Splitwise app</a> by allowing any group
    of people in a shared Discord server to share expenses, reducing daily money
    transfer down to a few transactions however often you want. Moolah does not
    require any new sign-ups or app downloads, working locally in your Discord
    server.

  <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-lightPurple mt-3">Project Path</h3>
  <ol class="ml-4">
    <li class="list-decimal">
      Started off as "RoomieBot": a rudimentary Discord bot that worked only in
      our server with our initials. A wrong input would probably break the bot.
    </li>
    <li class="list-decimal">
      Discord slash commands were released, and I realized I could make
      something much better and more versatile.
    </li>
    <li class="list-decimal">
      Reworked the entire bot, but kept the base functionality of sharing
      transactions between a group of people.
    </li>
    <li class="list-decimal">
      Utilized Discord's direct messaging to allow for personal transaction
      tracking and budgeting, and providing exporting capabilities to allow for
      integration with other budget trackers.
    </li>
  </ol>
